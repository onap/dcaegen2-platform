#TODO replace with concerete implementation of ConfigManager or its subclass
#Edit and Uncomment following line to export name of Class. 
# There is no need to invoke java explictly since its done in common start-config-manager.sh 
# It assumes that jar containing this class is in $VCC_HOME/lib .
# If it is anywhere other than $VCC_HOME/lib then uncomment following CLASSPATH
 
#export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:path_to_componentjar


#export CONFIGMGR_JAVACLASS=com.att.somecomponentpackage.ConcreteSubclassOfConfigManager
